# RaUno
The GitHub repository for my personal project rendition of the classic game, Uno. This game utilizes a server-client model to enable multiplayer gameplay.

To play, run the RaUno server (found in src/server/RaUnoServer.java). Then, run the RaUno client (found in src/client/RaUnoClient.java). To change the number of players, edit the PLAYERS field in RaUnoServer.java, and run as many clients as the value of PLAYERS. Be sure to edit the IP to which the client connects via the SERVER_IP field in RaUnoClient.java.

Must be run using Java 1.8.

All the code used was authored by Raul Hernandez in 2023 using Eclipse IDE.
